##### Unity Game Dev in C#

###### File Structure

-   `RPG-Game` is a RPG game developed by a group of 4, team members are `Yichao Wang (me)`, `Yiding Tao`, `Anh Le`, `Kien Ta`

    -   We develop using Unity and do source control using `Plastic SCM`, files are uploaded to git after the completion of the game

    -   See `Wiki Page` for more info

    

-   `Tutorial` = My own implementation of VG1 tutorials

    -   Q1: **Movement**
        -   You will construct a physics-driven game in which a player-controlled object must navigate a hazardous landscape to reach an end destination
